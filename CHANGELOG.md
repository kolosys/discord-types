## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-02

### Changed

- **Gateway Payload Types**: Simplified and consolidated gateway payload type definitions
  - Introduced generic `GatewayPayload[T]` base struct to eliminate repetitive code
  - Replaced verbose struct definitions with type aliases (e.g., `type Resume = GatewayPayload[ResumeData]`)
  - Consolidated `RequestGuildMembersData` union types into a single struct with optional fields
  - Removed empty marker method implementations (`isSendPayload()`, `isGatewaySendPayload()`, etc.)
  - Reduced file size from ~281 lines to ~120 lines (57% reduction)

### Improved

- **Code Maintainability**: Adding new payload types now requires only a type alias
- **Type Safety**: Maintained full type safety through Go's generic system
- **Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary interface method calls and reduced memory allocations
- **Developer Experience**: Cleaner, more readable code structure
